# 📝 Summary

- Today, vehicular customization can take months- sometimes years- of planning before
production and distribution is possible. Mach 5 Garage may be the solution to the cumbersome
process of car customization and personalization. Our database will prove to be useful when
storing large amounts of data with details about custom cars. Contributing dealerships around the
world can be granted access to this centralized database to accelerate purchasing, shipping, and
processing orders of car parts. These parts may include: paint, wraps, wheels, body kits, or other
personally-tailored decorations. For example, dealerships can have easier access to aftermarket
wheels from brands such as Enkei or Konig. If the details regarding this customization is detailed
and accessible, suppliers have the opportunity to sell parts or designs to more customers in an
efficient manner. If such data was stored in Microsoft Excel, the data spreadsheet would be
excessively long and hard to organize. Furthermore, queries would have to be very specific
(which not only slows down choosing customizations, but also slows down production and
assembly). Another deficiency in using Excel is the inability to perform multi-user queries. By
utilizing a database- manufacturing data can be categorized based on the customer’s priorities of
car performance- whether it be safety, efficiency, or high performance applications.

# 🎯 Target User 

> Detailed description about target user and how Mach 5 garage will solve the problem.

- This database will be accessed by customers, suppliers, and employees of the car dealership.
Authorized users will be managing the database. For example, supervising positions, such as
managers of the supplier warehouses, will manage the inventory of parts and be responsible for
routine checks to verify the database is storing correct values. Certain employees at the
dealership will have the authority to manage customer data (ensuring data integrity & security) such as retrieval of ownership details. Customers may have access to their personal data after
logging into their account, but will not be able to access other customer information.
